# SocketProgrammingPython

Examples of TCP/UDP sockets in python.
In TCP and UDP folders you can find two python files ( client and server ). These two programs will do the same, to be clear, the client can send a string through the socket channel to the server then, it turns all characters to uppercase ones and sends it back to the client. 
For running the program you can use python ( you should start the server file first). Files have been tested with python 3.7.

However in TCP fileserver folder you can upload a song from client to the server.
